                            A samosa (/səˈmoʊsə/) or singara is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions, and peas. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region.
                            Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.
                            Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa and their diasporas
